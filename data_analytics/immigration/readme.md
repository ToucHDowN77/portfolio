Covid-19 has created unprecedented working disturbances to the local agricultural economy which got disrupted by severe lack of working hands. To remedy this, the Greek state issued law no.4783/2021(article 16) that allowed on an exceptional basis the invitation of unskilled Albanian workers, using fast-track administrative procedures to catch up with the pressing needs of production in the field. This study examines comparatively immigration flows in Greece for both pandemic years, first in the total Greek area and then specifically to the Prefecture of Imathia, a geographical region located in Northern Greece which, along with the Prefecture of Pella, dominate the field of production and export of peaches, apples, cherries and kiwis in Greece. By analyzing available data, there will be an effort to standardize common trends within immigration flows and better organize the invitation system for the years to come.

## 1. Overview

This project will examine comparatively the incoming immigration flows from Albania to Greece, for the 'pandemic' years 2020 and 2021. General lockdown measures affected significantly national borders crossing, resulting in a unprecedented loss of work labour for Greece's agricultural sector, which traditionally and for many reasons, is not served by Greeks but by Albanians instead, through established bi-national Work Treaties. To overcome this problem, both interested parties came to a mutual understanding of bringing into effect a new legal and technical way of allowing immigration flows to come to Greece for work, that is summarized in the aforementioned art. 16, law no.4783/2021. Using its provisions, Greek farmers who request Albanian working hands, should follow a specific electronic process of applying for them and then the Civil Service issues the necessary permits that allow the entrance of the Albanina
