Covid-19 has created unprecedented working disturbances to the local agricultural economy which got disrupted by severe lack of working hands. To remedy this, the Greek state issued law no.4783/2021(article 16) that allowed on an exceptional basis the invitation of unskilled Albanian workers, using fast-track administrative procedures to catch up with the pressing needs of production in the field. This study examines comparatively immigration flows in Greece for both pandemic years, first in the total Greek area and then specifically to the Prefecture of Imathia, a geographical region located in Northern Greece which, along with the Prefecture of Pella, dominate the field of production and export of peaches, apples, cherries and kiwis in Greece. By analyzing available data, there will be an effort to standardize common trends within immigration flows and better organize the invitation system for the years to come.
